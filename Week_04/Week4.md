## Week 4 Tasks — Data Visualization in R and Python

Using a dataset you find interesting (or the example Uber dataset linked below), create a concise but insightful data visualization report. Focus on effective chart selection, clear aesthetics, and telling a data story. You may complete the tasks in either R (ggplot2) or Python (seaborn/matplotlib). Templates are provided in `Week_04/submission_template`.

Reference dataset (optional): [Uber Data Analytics Dashboard](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yashdevladdha/uber-ride-analytics-dashboard/data)

Guidance: Prefer tidy/tabular data; if your dataset needs light cleaning (rename columns, parse dates), do that in the notebook/Rmd before plotting.

### Task 1 — Setup and Data Loading
- Load the dataset and show first 5–10 rows
- Briefly describe variables and expected data types

---

### Task 2 — Univariate Visualizations
- Create at least 2 plots for single variables (e.g., histogram/density for numeric; bar plot for categorical)
- Annotate the key takeaway under each plot

---

### Task 3 — Bivariate Visualizations
- Create at least 2 plots showing relationships (e.g., scatter with regression line; box/violin by category)
- Explain what the relationship suggests

---

### Task 4 — Multivariate Visualizations
- Use color/shape/size encodings or small multiples (facets) to show a third variable
- Add a short interpretation

---

### Task 5 — Temporal or Composition Analysis
- If time exists: line plot(s), rolling averages, or heatmap (e.g., day vs hour)
- If no time: composition (stacked bars or 100% bars) or a treemap/sunburst alternative

---

### Task 6 — Geospatial (Bonus)
- If latitude/longitude or regions exist, produce a simple map (choropleth or point map)
- Briefly describe your mapping choices

---

### Task 7 — Aesthetics and Clarity
- Apply a clean theme, readable labels, titles, and legends
- Ensure color choices are colorblind-friendly where possible

---

### Task 8 — Narrative and Reproducibility
- Write a short narrative (5–10 sentences) connecting the plots into a cohesive story
- Ensure the notebook/Rmd runs top-to-bottom with no manual steps

---

### Deliverables

Submit both in R and Python:

- R: An R Markdown file `Week4_Tasks.Rmd` knitted to PDF
- Python: A Jupyter Notebook `Week4_Tasks.ipynb`

Use the provided templates in `Week_04/submission_template/`.

Your submission should include all tasks, plots with captions/annotations, and brief interpretations.
